# GuitarChordEarTrainer
If you browse guitar forums for any length of time, you'll see that many people feel overwhelmed by trying to learn things by ear on guitar. This program helps to remove some of the uncertainty that prevents people from working on their ear. This program will play chord voicings that make hand sense on guitar, and display the frets when the user wants to see them. The included database has all unique 2 note voicings (dyads), and 3 note voicings. New voicings and tags can also be entered into the database in-program.

For someone that's really new to using their ear, I would recommond this sequence of active tags:
1. Dyads
2. Major/Minor Triads
3. All Triads
4. All three note voicings

# Usage
The only non-standard library in this program is rtmidi, which can be installed with pip.
