Database
- Read in multiple tags
- create methods for selecting groups of provided tags
    - and handing a single fingering back
- refine the fingering parser and fetcher, it won't work once you input voicings with multiple tags
GUI
- Design layout
- image for fingering? or list fret numbers?
-- no current working freboard drawing libraries for python
-- would be easier to list frets next to string names
